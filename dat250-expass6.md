I have made experiments with front-end technologies for enterprise applications. Where we can create an user, create a poll with an user and then vote with users.

**Technical problems that you encountered during the completion of the tutorial**

I had problems with multiple notation of @JsonBackReference and @JsonManagedReference and fixed it with tags that tag the correct link
I had problems with finding a way how to use post with fetch in Svelte, found out it needs its own request method.
I had problem finding out a solution for auto reload. it was  window.location.reload() in the method
I didnt know how binding worked in for example input boxes and how to link them to variables. Making variable with let and then using {} to call them

**Any pending issues with this assignment which you did not manage to solve**
My last testcase seems like to interfearing with other test cases.
